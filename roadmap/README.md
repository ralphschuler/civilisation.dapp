# Civilization DApp Roadmap

This folder captures staged milestones translating the high-level 4X-light vision into actionable deliverables. Each milestone combines:

- **Purpose**: Why the milestone matters for the product vision.
- **Current Coverage**: What already exists in the repository or docs that contributes toward the goal.
- **Expected Deliverables**: Scope required to complete the milestone.
- **Definition of Done**: Verifiable exit criteria for sign-off.
- **Dependencies & Risks**: Known external factors or uncertainties.

Start with `00-foundation.md` to align on the present state, then progress sequentially through city loop, war/world systems, on-chain/live ops, and finally launch readiness.
