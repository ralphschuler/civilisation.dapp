# Milestone 4: Launch Readiness & Growth

## Purpose
Prepare the product for public launch with polished UX, scalable operations, monetisation safeguards (non-pay-to-win), and community support infrastructure.

## Current Coverage
- Settings, profile, notifications, achievements, and help/support screens scaffolded to host post-launch features.
- Reports and stats modules exist with placeholder data, enabling future integration with combat logs and player analytics.
- Documentation pipeline (`docs/` + wiki deploy workflow) ready to publish guides and changelogs.

## Expected Deliverables
1. Comprehensive QA and localisation pass, including RTL support if target markets require it.
2. Community infrastructure: support knowledge base, moderation tooling, in-app announcements, and alliance recruitment features.
3. Monetisation safeguards ensuring optional cosmetics/battle passes do not break fair-play pillar; implement storefront or pass UI if applicable.
4. Marketing integration: deep links, referral tracking, store listings, trailer assets, and feature flag system for staged rollouts.
5. Post-launch roadmap with live ops cadence, balance patch process, and backlog triage rituals.

## Definition of Done
- Release candidate builds signed, passing store submission requirements and WebView constraints.
- Incident communication channels (Discord, Status page) tested with dry runs.
- KPIs instrumented (DAU, retention, conversion, alliance participation) with dashboards reviewed by leadership.
- Retro + learnings documented, feeding into next-season planning.

## Dependencies & Risks
- External dependencies (app stores, marketing campaigns) may shift timelines; maintain buffer and comms plan.
- Support volume could spike; ensure staffing model and escalation paths are defined.
- Feature flag framework must be battle-tested to avoid degraded player experience during staged rollouts.
