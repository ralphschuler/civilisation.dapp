            You are working in a Bun + TypeScript monorepo with Foundry contracts and GitHub Actions.
            Read the repository, run the Bun lint and build scripts as well as `forge test`,
            identify the minimal change needed to make these commands succeed, implement only that change, and stop.
            Do not refactor unrelated code or files. Keep changes small and surgical.
