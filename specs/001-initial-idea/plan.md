# Implementation Plan: Initial Idea

**Branch**: `001-initial-idea` | **Date**: 2025-10-05 | **Spec**: [link](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-initial-idea/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from file system structure or context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code, or `AGENTS.md` for all other agents).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
The "Initial Idea" feature focuses on a deterministic blockchain strategy game where players manage villages, resources, and armies, with all actions executed on-chain. Technical approach leverages modular architecture, Zustand for state management, Solidity smart contracts, and IndexedDB for state persistence. Clarifications ensure resource scaling, battle outcomes, concurrent actions, and error handling are well-defined.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.8, Solidity  
**Primary Dependencies**: React, Zustand, Radix UI, TailwindCSS, Viem, @worldcoin/minikit-js, @worldcoin/minikit-react  
**Storage**: IndexedDB (MVP), fallback retry logic  
**Testing**: Jest, Solhint  
**Target Platform**: Web (EVM-compatible blockchains)  
**Project Type**: Web application  
**Performance Goals**: Deterministic execution, low gas costs  
**Constraints**: EIP-2535 Diamond Standard, secure Solidity practices  
**Scale/Scope**: Support for thousands of concurrent players

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*
- **Library-First**: All components must be modular and independently testable.
- **CLI Interface**: Libraries expose CLI functionality for testing and debugging.
- **Test-First**: TDD is mandatory for all new features.
- **Integration Testing**: Focus on contract interactions and shared schemas.
- **Observability**: Structured logging and deterministic outputs required.
- **Tech Stack**: React, TypeScript, Vite, Zustand, Radix UI, TailwindCSS, Viem, @worldcoin/minikit-js, @worldcoin/minikit-react, Solidity, OpenZeppelin, Forge
- **Compliance**: EIP-2535 Diamond Standard, contract audits, secure development
- **Deployment**: EVM-compatible, CI/CD, versioning
