# Feature Specification: Initial Idea

**Feature Branch**: `001-initial-idea`  
**Created**: 2025-10-05  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Civilisation.dapp is a fully deterministic blockchain strategy game that merges the depth of classic empire builders with the transparency and permanence of Web3. Inspired by legendary titles like Tribal Wars and Stronghold, the game invites players to construct villages, manage resources, train armies, and engage in large-scale wars — all executed entirely through smart contracts on the blockchain."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Players build and manage their own civilizations, producing resources, training units, and engaging in battles. All actions are executed on-chain, ensuring transparency and verifiability.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a player owns a village NFT, **When** they upgrade a building, **Then** the building level increases and resource production improves.
2. **Given** a player trains units, **When** they deploy them in battle, **Then** the battle outcome is deterministic and verifiable on-chain.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a player attempts an upgrade without sufficient resources?
- How does the system handle simultaneous actions from multiple players targeting the same village?
- Simultaneous actions: On-chain resolution via Worldchain, client-side first-come, first-served.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow players to own villages as NFTs.
- **FR-002**: System MUST enable resource production and claiming based on building levels.
- **FR-003**: Players MUST be able to train and deploy military units.
- **FR-004**: System MUST execute battles deterministically without RNG.
- **FR-005**: All game actions MUST be verifiable on-chain.
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle concurrent player actions gracefully.
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide a persistent game state using repositories (e.g., LocalStorage, Mock, IndexedDB).
- **FR-008**: System MUST support modular architecture for future expansions (e.g., diplomacy, trade).
- **FR-009**: System MUST integrate with Zustand stores for state management.
- **FR-010**: Resource production rates MUST use a configurable modifier per building/unit (e.g., x1.6 per level).
- **FR-011**: Battle outcomes MUST be determined by unit type, unit defense, attack, agility, and village wall level.
- **FR-012**: Simultaneous actions targeting the same village MUST be resolved by Worldchain on-chain logic; client-side uses first-come, first-served.
- **FR-013**: State persistence for MVP MUST use IndexedDB as the primary backend.
- **FR-014**: Repository failures MUST trigger a retry mechanism up to N times before surfacing an error to the user.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Village**: Represents a player’s civilization, including buildings, resources, and units.
- **Building**: Tracks levels and production rates for resources.
- **Unit**: Represents military forces with specific attributes (e.g., type, strength).
- **Battle**: Stores details of engagements between players, including participants and outcomes.
- **GameState**: Represents the overall state of the game, including villages, marches, and player stats.
- **Repository**: Abstracts data persistence for game state, villages, and reports.

## Clarifications

### Session 1: Key Questions
- **Resource Management**: How will resource production rates scale with building levels?
- **Battle Mechanics**: What specific attributes will determine battle outcomes (e.g., unit type, terrain)?
- **Concurrent Actions**: How will the system prioritize or resolve simultaneous actions targeting the same village?

### Session 2: Technical Details
- **On-Chain Verification**: What tools or libraries will be used to ensure deterministic execution?
- **State Persistence**: Should IndexedDB be prioritized for larger datasets, or is LocalStorage sufficient for MVP?
- **Error Handling**: What fallback mechanisms will be in place for repository failures?
