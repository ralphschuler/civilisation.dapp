# Civilisation Branding Assets

This folder contains SVG assets that follow the Civilisation brand direction (ancient power + digital precision) for the World App MiniKit experience.

## App Icon Concepts

| File | Concept | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `app-icon-crown.svg` | Glowing Crown | Golden crown rising from stone with cyan rune glow and Cinzel "C" monogram. |
| `app-icon-shield.svg` | Digital Shield | Split medieval shield blending steel texture with cyan blockchain veins and engraved "CIVIL". |
| `app-icon-citadel.svg` | Rising Citadel | Stylised fortress silhouette with cyan data beams and gold highlights, optimised for small sizes. |

## Store Preview / Hero Images

Each hero graphic uses the blue/gold/cyan palette with serif display typography and geometric UI accents.

1. `preview-build-your-kingdom.svg` — City-building overview with resource overlays. Caption: *From humble village to mighty empire.*
2. `preview-rule-through-strategy.svg` — Tactical planner with glowing battle paths. Caption: *Plan. Conquer. Expand.*
3. `preview-on-the-world-chain.svg` — Worldcoin-inspired coin close-up emphasising on-chain ownership. Caption: *Own your progress, on-chain.*
4. `preview-epic-alliances.svg` — Allied armies converging beneath radiant banners. Caption: *Unite or be conquered.*
5. `preview-your-legacy-awaits.svg` — Hero overlooking a digital-medieval horizon. Caption: *CIVIL — Build a world that remembers you.*

## Optional Motion Ideas

* **Animated Logo Reveal**: Use the crown or shield icon, animate gold particles converging while cyan runes ignite. Layered in After Effects using these SVGs as vector sources.
* **Splash Screen**: Slow zoom on the chosen icon with subtle cyan pulse (approx. 8-second loop).
* **Loading Spinner**: Rotate the coin center from `preview-on-the-world-chain.svg` or animate the crown gem as a glowing indicator.

> Tip: Because all assets are vector-based SVGs, they can be exported to PNG/WebP at any required resolution for MiniKit distribution.
